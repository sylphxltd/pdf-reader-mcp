# Create Git Commit

## Context

- Current git status: !`git status`
- Current git diff (staged and unstaged changes): !`git diff HEAD`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -10`

## Your Task

Based on the above changes, create a single git commit with a meaningful commit message that:

1. Follows conventional commits format: `type(scope): description`
2. Accurately describes what changed and why
3. Includes any breaking changes or important notes
4. Uses present tense ("add" not "added")

After creating the commit, show the commit message for review.
