## Development Setup

This project uses [Bun](https://bun.sh/) and [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/).

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 22.13.0
- Bun >= 1.3.12

### Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SylphxAI/pdf-reader-mcp.git
cd pdf-reader-mcp
bun install
bun run build
```

### Useful Commands

```bash
bun run check          # Lint and format check (Biome)
bun run check:fix      # Auto-fix lint and format issues
bun run typecheck      # TypeScript type checking
bun test               # Run tests
bun run test:cov       # Run tests with coverage
bun run build          # Build the package
bun run package:smoke  # Verify package tarball
bun run docs:build     # Build docs site
bun run benchmark      # Run performance benchmark
```

### Coding Standards

- **Formatting and linting:** Handled by Biome (configuration in `biome.json`). Run `bun run check` before submitting.
- **Testing:** Write tests using Bun's built-in test runner. Place test files in `test/` mirroring the source structure.
- **Types:** All code must pass `bun run typecheck` with no errors.
- **Commits:** Follow conventional commits (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`).

### Release Process

Releases are automated via [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets):

1. Add a changeset describing your change: `bunx changeset`
2. The changeset bot will create a "Version Packages" PR when changesets accumulate.
3. Merging the version PR triggers the release workflow to publish to npm and create a GitHub Release.

Do not manually publish to npm or create tags/releases.
