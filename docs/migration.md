# Migration and recovery notes

This page is **secondary engineering history**. Product install lives on the [Installation](/guide/installation) guide and repository README.

## Current production

- Current production identity: `@sylphx/citra@5.0.0`
- Engine: native Rust via thin Node launcher
- No TypeScript PDF runtime in the production package
- No `./typescript` export
- Missing native package fails closed

## Install

Use the brand-sole Citra package:

```bash
npx -y @sylphx/citra
```

The retired `@sylphx/pdf-reader-mcp` package ID is historical evidence and a
comparison pin, not a current install or publish path.

## Historical TypeScript baseline

Immutable external baseline for comparison/recovery only:

```bash
npm install -g @sylphx/pdf-reader-mcp@3.0.14
```

## Transitional history

- `3.2.2`: Rust-default with bundled TypeScript rollback (not Sole Rust)
- `4.0.0`: Sole-Rust runtime cutover that still declared TS/PDF.js production dependencies
- `4.0.1`: empty production dependency graph; Linux x64 native packaging defect
- `4.0.2`: Sole-Rust dependency-closure with installable five-platform natives
- `4.1.0`: warm read cache + strip/LTO natives + product performance evidence
- `4.1.1`: npm README / claims sync of the authorized 4.1 narrative
- `5.0.0`: hard cut to the brand-sole `@sylphx/citra` package, `citra` command,
  Citra native package family, and `io.github.SylphxAI/citra` MCP identity

## Performance admission status

Registry-bound dual-mode evidence for the 4.1 lineage remains historical and
method-bounded. It does not by itself prove current Citra target coverage; see
the current host-runtime and registry-install proof workflows.
