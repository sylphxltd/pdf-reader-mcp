# Why pure Rust + open gaps

> **Status:** experimental. **Not** a full drop-in for TypeScript 3.0.14.
> Published stable remains `@sylphx/pdf-reader-mcp@3.0.14`.


## The product decision

`@sylphx/pdf-reader-mcp` is a **starred public MCP**. Agents call it thousands of
times. The right end state is not “half TypeScript, half Rust, please wait while
we migrate” — it is **one native engine** with the same public tools and the same
Agent Document Twin fields.

The withdrawn v3.1.x releases did **not** reach that end state. The intended
replacement, once it passes the executable parity and release gates, is:

- **npm**: `@sylphx/pdf-reader-mcp` → ships the native `pdf-reader-mcp-server`
- **crates.io**: `pdf-reader-core`, `pdf-reader-mcp-server`, `pdf-reader-cli`
- **Tools**: `read_pdf`, `search_pdf`, and every `pdf_evidence` success and failure path

## What must not regress

Updating the implementation language must **not** remove public capabilities.
The replacement must reproduce the Document Twin semantics, not merely return
fields with these names. Today many pure-Rust fields are heuristic or empty;
their current status is recorded in the
[capability matrix](../specs/pure-rust-capability-matrix.json).

| Capability group | Fields / operations |
| --- | --- |
| Core text | `full_text`, `markdown`, `html`, `chunks`, `elements`, `text_layer` |
| Structure | `tables`, `document_map`, `document_ast`, `layout_diagnostics` |
| Safety / trust | `safety_findings`, `trust_report`, `accessibility_report` |
| Document signals | `outline`, `annotations`, `form_fields`, `attachments`, `structure_trees`, `page_labels`, `page_geometry`, `permissions` |
| Provider opt-in | `ocr_text_layer` has a bounded command-provider fusion subset; without a provider the field is omitted with an explicit warning, matching TS failure semantics. `visual_enrichments` remains a placeholder. |
| Evidence | `pdf_evidence` `inspect` (routing); visual ops fail closed with guidance when no render/OCR backend is configured |

The following commands exercise only the currently claimed subset. They are
not a drop-in or release-admission proof:

```bash
bun run build:rust
bun test test/production/capabilityParity.contract.test.ts --timeout=600000
bun run check:production-contract
```

## Benchmark method

```bash
bun run build:rust
bun run benchmark:pure-rust -- --iterations 20 --warmup 3 \
  --output benchmark-artifacts/pdf_pure_rust_benchmark.json
```

Scenarios (fixed fixture `test/fixtures/sample.pdf`):

1. `metadata_page_count`
2. `full_text`
3. `agent_document_twin_balanced` (auto)
4. `agent_document_twin_full` (explicit include_*)
5. `search_literal`
6. `inspect`

Each scenario warms up, then records avg / min / max / p50 / p95 over N iterations
against the **production pure-Rust binary**.

Historical TypeScript timings are retained below only as provenance for an old
measurement. They were not collected in the same run, on a digest-bound
semantically equivalent candidate, and therefore cannot establish a speedup:

| Scenario | Historical TS avg |
| --- | --- |
| Metadata + page count | 1.1 ms |
| Full text | 16.1 ms |
| Agent Document Twin | 27.2 ms |

The pure-Rust harness currently writes a `comparison` block, but those ratios
are diagnostic historical comparisons and must not be used as release or
marketing claims.

## Historical diagnostic run (not an A/B benchmark)

Fixture: `test/fixtures/sample.pdf` · iterations=15 · warmup=3 · measuredAt=2026-07-17T23:15:41.531Z

| Scenario | Pure-Rust avg | Pure-Rust p50 | Pure-Rust p95 | Historical TS avg | Speedup |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Metadata + page count | 11.174 ms | 11.665 ms | 13.318 ms | 1.1 ms | 0.10× |
| Full text | 8.041 ms | 5.875 ms | 14.169 ms | 16.1 ms | 2.00× |
| Agent Document Twin (balanced) | 8.227 ms | 6.447 ms | 14.826 ms | 27.2 ms | 3.31× |
| Agent Document Twin (full includes) | 12.916 ms | 12.516 ms | 18.278 ms | — | — |
| search_pdf literal | 0.862 ms | 0.735 ms | 1.573 ms | — | — |
| pdf_evidence inspect | 9.325 ms | 9.158 ms | 13.206 ms | — | — |

No speedup claim is admissible from this table. A release benchmark must run
TS 3.0.14 and the exact Rust candidate on the same host and corpus, verify
semantically equivalent outputs before timing, randomize/interleave samples,
separate cold and warm paths, and retain raw samples plus source, fixture,
binary, toolchain, and environment digests.

Artifact: `benchmark-artifacts/pdf_pure_rust_benchmark.json`.


## Why performance work still matters

- **Agent loops are serial.** Verified latency reductions compound across tool calls.
- **Cold start matters for MCP.** It must be measured separately from warm calls.
- **Ops cost.** A native distribution can simplify deployment only after cross-platform packaging is proven.

## Capability honesty

Pure-Rust text extraction currently uses the selectable text layer. Geometry,
visual evidence, and full Document Twin parity remain open work. Empty
placeholder arrays prove only response shape; they do not prove capability.

Visual `pdf_evidence` operations now have bounded Hayro render/crop plus opt-in
command-provider OCR and region-analysis subsets. `read_pdf` can now select OCR
pages, invoke that bounded command provider, return the normalized parallel OCR
layer, link applied pages into `document_map`, emit OCR MCP text parts, and
project one bounded boxed-word table subset through tables, elements, chunks,
Markdown, HTML, AST, and map. The immutable detached TS 3.0.14 differential
covers these bounded fusion cases. It remains partial: mixed selectable/OCR
table continuation, full AST hierarchy, OCR TSV, region-analysis HTTP/presets,
broader renderer fixtures, and full Document Twin fusion are open. Unavailable
paths fail closed; this is not TS 3.0.14 parity.

## Install

Production: pin `@sylphx/pdf-reader-mcp@3.0.14` (TypeScript).  
See [installation guide](../guide/installation.md). Pure-Rust remains experimental source-only.

### Configured-command visual enrichment fusion (bounded)

A frozen five-case configured-command `read_pdf` visual-enrichment payload and Document Map fusion subset is admitted through the exact-SHA differential harness. It covers direct table fusion, page sort/dedup/invalid + max-one admission, ordered two-caption analyses, fail-closed second-provider failure, and ready/no-candidate zero invocation. `include_visual_enrichments` remains `PARTIAL`; Document AST visual fusion and HTTP/preset providers are unclaimed. `dropInFor3014` stays false and publish freeze remains enabled.

### Document AST visual enrichment fusion (bounded)

A frozen five-case configured-command `read_pdf` visual-enrichment Document AST fusion subset is admitted through the exact-SHA differential harness.

### URL source single-fetch public-stdio subset (bounded)

A frozen two-case public-stdio URL source single-fetch subset is admitted for `read_pdf` over a local fixture HTTP server with `MCP_PDF_ALLOW_PRIVATE_IPS=true`: no-OCR single fetch and OCR-with-document-map single fetch that reuses materialized bytes.

### search_pdf prefer_speed route (post-3.0.14 surface)

Pure-Rust `search_pdf` now accepts `prefer_speed` and, when OCR is off, matches the current TypeScript speed route: match geometry is omitted, provenance uses `rust-text-index`/`text-content`, and the speed-route warning is emitted. This is a current-surface parity fix, not a frozen detached TS v3.0.14 differential claim. `prefer_speed` remains `PARTIAL` in the capability matrix; `dropInFor3014` stays false and publish freeze remains enabled.

### read_pdf include_metadata linearized residual (frozen TS v3.0.14)

A frozen three-case public-stdio `read_pdf` `include_metadata` linearized residual is admitted: pdf.js `IsLinearized` matches `Linearization.create` over exact source bytes — valid first-object linearization dictionaries are true; spurious `Linearized` dictionaries (bad `L`/`H`) and absent linearization are false.

A frozen two-case public-stdio `read_pdf` `include_annotations` text inverted-rect residual is admitted: Text without appearance normalizes inverted `/Rect` first (pdf.js `lookupNormalRect`) then applies the 22×22 icon box from the normalized top-left; ordinary no-appearance Text keeps the same icon-box rule. Leaf-mutation count is frozen at 28 with relocated fixture-root replay. `include_annotations` remains `PARTIAL`; Name field, glyph-perfect boxes, appearance-stream geometry, and whole-product parity remain unclaimed. `dropInFor3014` stays false and publish freeze remains enabled.

A frozen two-case public-stdio `read_pdf` `include_form_fields` residual is admitted: checkbox/radiobutton/pushbutton non-empty `/V` name arrays preserve pdf.js string arrays, plain string button values remain strings, empty button arrays collapse to `Off`, and absent `/V` falls back to a non-empty `/DV` array for both `value` and `default_value`. Leaf-mutation count is frozen at 68 with relocated fixture-root replay. `include_form_fields` remains `PARTIAL`; malformed-field breadth, nested Kids beyond the parent/child residual, and whole-product parity remain unclaimed. `dropInFor3014` stays false and publish freeze remains enabled.


### read_pdf include_attachments attachment odd-names residual (frozen TS v3.0.14)

A frozen two-case public-stdio `read_pdf` `include_attachments` attachment odd-names residual is admitted: odd-length EmbeddedFiles `Names` arrays keep complete key/value pairs and materialize a trailing unpaired key as `filename=unnamed` without `size_bytes` (pdf.js NameTree), covering orphan-only and pair-plus-orphan fixtures. Leaf-mutation count is frozen at 15 with relocated fixture-root replay. `include_attachments` remains `PARTIAL`; broader malformed name-tree breadth, duplicate-kids fail-closed, and whole-product parity remain unclaimed. `dropInFor3014` stays false and publish freeze remains enabled.

Leaf-mutation count is frozen at 52 with relocated fixture-root replay. `include_form_fields` remains `PARTIAL`; split-surrogate wire parity, metadata/annotation UTF-16 breadth, and whole-product parity remain unclaimed. `dropInFor3014` stays false and publish freeze remains enabled.

### public-stdio utf16-text residual (frozen TS v3.0.14)

A frozen three-case public-stdio utf16-text residual is admitted: pdf.js `stringToPDFString` odd-length UTF-16BE trailing-byte drop for Text annotation title/contents, FreeText contents, outline titles, and metadata `Title`/`Author`. Leaf-mutation count is frozen at 41 with relocated fixture-root replay.

### read_pdf include_annotations text invalid-as residual (frozen TS v3.0.14)

A frozen two-case public-stdio `read_pdf` `include_annotations` text invalid-as residual is admitted: Text `AP/N` named-state dictionaries with invalid `AS` selection fall back to the 22×22 icon box (pdf.js `setAppearance`) for missing `AS` name and `AS` pointing at a non-stream.

Valid `AS` raw-rect selection remains covered by the named-appearance residual. `include_annotations` remains `PARTIAL`; Name field, glyph-perfect boxes, and whole-product parity remain unclaimed. `dropInFor3014` stays false and publish freeze remains enabled.

### read_pdf include_annotations line annotation residual (frozen TS v3.0.14)

A frozen three-case public-stdio `read_pdf` `include_annotations` line annotation residual is admitted: Line annotations without appearance expand the public bounding box like pdf.js `LineAnnotation` — default border width 1 expansion, non-intersecting `Rect` replaced from `/L` with `2*width` then public expand by width, and `BS/W=2` expansion. Leaf-mutation count is frozen at 39 with relocated fixture-root replay. `include_annotations` remains `PARTIAL`; line endings `LE`, appearance-stream geometry, PolyLine/Polygon, and whole-product parity remain unclaimed. `dropInFor3014` stays false and publish freeze remains enabled.


### read_pdf include_annotations polyline/polygon residual (frozen TS v3.0.14)

A frozen three-case public-stdio `read_pdf` `include_annotations` polyline/polygon residual is admitted: PolyLine/Polygon annotations without appearance replace a non-intersecting public bounding box from the vertices bbox expanded by `2*borderWidth` like pdf.js `PolylineAnnotation`/`PolygonAnnotation` — default border width 1, Polygon subtype, and `BS/W=2` with a non-clamped Rect. Leaf-mutation count is frozen at 39. Line endings `LE`, appearance-stream geometry, Ink, tiny-Rect border-width clamp, and whole-product parity remain unclaimed; `include_annotations` remains `PARTIAL`.



### read_pdf include_annotations ink annotation residual (frozen TS v3.0.14)

A frozen three-case public-stdio `read_pdf` `include_annotations` ink annotation residual is admitted: Ink annotations without appearance replace a non-intersecting public bounding box from the InkList points bbox expanded by `2*borderWidth` like pdf.js `InkAnnotation` — default border width 1, multi-stroke union, and `BS/W=2` with a non-clamped Rect. Leaf-mutation count is frozen at 39. Appearance-stream geometry, tiny-Rect border-width clamp, and whole-product parity remain unclaimed; `include_annotations` remains `PARTIAL`.



### read_pdf include_annotations border-width clamp residual (frozen TS v3.0.14)

A frozen three-case public-stdio `read_pdf` `include_annotations` border-width clamp residual is admitted: when `BS/W` exceeds half of either `Rect` dimension, pdf.js `AnnotationBorderStyle.setWidth` clamps width to 1 before Line/PolyLine/Ink public bounding-box expansion. Tiny non-intersecting Rect fixtures prove the clamp for PolyLine, Line, and Ink. Leaf-mutation count is frozen at 39. Border array form, zero-size Rect clamp-bypass breadth, appearance-stream geometry, and whole-product parity remain unclaimed; `include_annotations` remains `PARTIAL`.



### read_pdf include_annotations border-array width residual (frozen TS v3.0.14)

A frozen three-case public-stdio `read_pdf` `include_annotations` border-array width residual is admitted: when `BS` is absent, pdf.js `Annotation.setBorderStyle` takes width from `Border` array index 2 and uses it for Line/PolyLine/Ink public bounding-box expansion. Large non-intersecting Rect fixtures prove PolyLine `Border [0 0 2]`, Line `Border [0 0 2]`, and Ink `Border [0 0 3]`. Leaf-mutation count is frozen at 39. Border array length < 3, BS preference over Border, zero-size Rect clamp-bypass breadth, appearance-stream geometry, and whole-product parity remain unclaimed; `include_annotations` remains `PARTIAL`.



### read_pdf include_annotations border BS preference residual (frozen TS v3.0.14)

A frozen three-case public-stdio `read_pdf` `include_annotations` border BS preference residual is admitted: when both `BS` and `Border` are present, pdf.js `Annotation.setBorderStyle` prefers the `BS` dictionary width `W` over `Border[2]` before Line/PolyLine/Ink public bounding-box expansion. Large non-intersecting Rect fixtures prove PolyLine/Line `BS/W=2` over `Border [0 0 9]` and Ink `BS/W=3` over `Border [0 0 9]`. Leaf-mutation count is frozen at 39. Border array length < 3, zero-size Rect clamp-bypass breadth, appearance-stream geometry, non-dict BS fallthrough breadth, and whole-product parity remain unclaimed; `include_annotations` remains `PARTIAL`.


### read_pdf include_annotations border BS nondict residual (frozen TS v3.0.14)

A frozen three-case public-stdio `read_pdf` `include_annotations` border BS nondict residual is admitted: when the `BS` key is present but is not a usable Border-style dictionary (here `null`), pdf.js `Annotation.setBorderStyle` does **not** fall through to `Border[2]` and keeps the default width 1 before Line/PolyLine/Ink public bounding-box expansion. Large non-intersecting Rect fixtures prove PolyLine/Line/Ink with `BS null` over `Border [0 0 9]`. Leaf-mutation count is frozen at 39. Wrong-Type BS breadth, Border array length < 3, zero-size Rect clamp-bypass breadth, appearance-stream geometry, and whole-product parity remain unclaimed; `include_annotations` remains `PARTIAL`.


### read_pdf include_annotations border array short residual (frozen TS v3.0.14)

A frozen three-case public-stdio `read_pdf` `include_annotations` border array short residual is admitted: when `BS` is absent and `Border` has length &lt; 3, pdf.js `Annotation.setBorderStyle` does not read a missing width index — empty arrays call `setWidth(0)` and short non-empty arrays leave the default width — and drawing uses `width || 1` before Line/PolyLine/Ink public bounding-box expansion. Large non-intersecting Rect fixtures prove PolyLine `Border [0 0]`, Line `Border []`, and Ink `Border [0]`. Leaf-mutation count is frozen at 39. BS-present short Border combinations, zero-size Rect clamp-bypass breadth, appearance-stream geometry, and whole-product parity remain unclaimed; `include_annotations` remains `PARTIAL`.


### read_pdf include_annotations border BS wrong-type residual (frozen TS v3.0.14)

A frozen three-case public-stdio `read_pdf` `include_annotations` border BS wrong-type residual is admitted: when `BS` is a dictionary whose `Type` is present and not `Border`, pdf.js `Annotation.setBorderStyle` ignores `BS/W` and does not fall through to `Border[2]`, keeping default width 1 before Line/PolyLine/Ink public bounding-box expansion. Large non-intersecting Rect fixtures prove PolyLine/Line/Ink with `BS Type /NotBorder W 9` over `Border [0 0 5]`. Leaf-mutation count is frozen at 39. Missing-Type BS (uses W), zero-size Rect clamp-bypass breadth, appearance-stream geometry, and whole-product parity remain unclaimed; `include_annotations` remains `PARTIAL`.


### read_pdf include_annotations border zero-size clamp-bypass residual (frozen TS v3.0.14)

A frozen three-case public-stdio `read_pdf` `include_annotations` border zero-size clamp-bypass residual is admitted: when `Rect` has a zero dimension, pdf.js `AnnotationBorderStyle.setWidth` does not clamp `BS/W` because the half-dimension gate requires both maxWidth and maxHeight &gt; 0. Line/PolyLine/Ink public bounding-box expansion therefore uses the unclamped width. Fixtures prove PolyLine/Line zero-height `Rect` + `BS/W=2` and Ink zero-width `Rect` + `BS/W=2` on non-intersecting geometry. Leaf-mutation count is frozen at 39. Positive-dimension clamp cases, appearance-stream geometry, and whole-product parity remain unclaimed; `include_annotations` remains `PARTIAL`.


### read_pdf include_annotations appearance bbox residual (frozen TS v3.0.14)

A frozen three-case public-stdio `read_pdf` `include_annotations` appearance bbox residual is admitted: when `AP/N` is present, Line/PolyLine/Ink keep the raw `Rect` public bounding box and skip the no-appearance L/vertices/InkList expansion path used by pdf.js when appearance is absent. Large non-intersecting Rect fixtures with empty `AP/N` streams and `BS/W=2` prove Line/PolyLine/Ink keep `{200,200,300,300}` instead of expanded geometry boxes. Leaf-mutation count is frozen at 39. Appearance-stream content bbox derivation, line endings `LE`, named appearance states, and whole-product parity remain unclaimed; `include_annotations` remains `PARTIAL`.


### read_pdf include_annotations AP non-stream residual (frozen TS v3.0.14)

A frozen three-case public-stdio `read_pdf` `include_annotations` AP non-stream residual is admitted: when `AP/N` is present but is not a usable appearance stream (`null` or name), pdf.js `Annotation.setAppearance` leaves appearance unset, so Line/PolyLine/Ink still apply no-appearance L/vertices/InkList bounding-box expansion with `BS/W`. Fixtures prove Line/Ink `AP/N null` and PolyLine `AP/N /NotAStream` with non-intersecting large Rect and `BS/W=2` expand geometry instead of keeping raw Rect. Leaf-mutation count is frozen at 39. Named appearance-state selection, appearance-stream content bbox derivation, line endings `LE`, and whole-product parity remain unclaimed; `include_annotations` remains `PARTIAL`.


### read_pdf include_annotations AP named-state residual (frozen TS v3.0.14)

A frozen three-case public-stdio `read_pdf` `include_annotations` AP named-state residual is admitted: when `AP/N` is a named-state dictionary, pdf.js `Annotation.setAppearance` selects the `AS` stream (appearance present → Line keeps raw Rect) and leaves appearance unset when `AS` is missing or does not select a stream (Line still expands L geometry with `BS/W`). Fixtures prove Line `AS /On` keeps `{200,200,300,300}` while missing/`Off` AS expand to `{4,4,106,86}` with `BS/W=2` on non-intersecting large Rect. Leaf-mutation count is frozen at 39. Appearance-stream content bbox derivation, line endings `LE`, PolyLine/Ink named-state breadth, and whole-product parity remain unclaimed; `include_annotations` remains `PARTIAL`.


### read_pdf include_annotations AP named-state polyline/ink residual (frozen TS v3.0.14)

A frozen three-case public-stdio `read_pdf` `include_annotations` AP named-state polyline/ink residual is admitted: PolyLine/Ink `AP/N` named-state dictionaries follow pdf.js `Annotation.setAppearance` AS selection — `AS` stream keeps raw Rect; missing/invalid AS leaves appearance unset so PolyLine/Ink expand vertices/InkList with `BS/W`. Fixtures prove PolyLine `AS /On` keeps `{200,200,300,300}`, Ink missing AS expands to `{26,26,104,94}`, and PolyLine invalid AS expands to `{6,6,104,84}` with `BS/W=2` on non-intersecting large Rect. Leaf-mutation count is frozen at 39. Appearance-stream content bbox derivation, line endings `LE`, Square/Circle named-state breadth, and whole-product parity remain unclaimed; `include_annotations` remains `PARTIAL`.


### read_pdf include_annotations AP named-state square/circle residual (frozen TS v3.0.14)

A frozen three-case public-stdio `read_pdf` `include_annotations` AP named-state square/circle residual is admitted: Square/Circle `AP/N` named-state dictionaries follow pdf.js `Annotation.setAppearance` AS selection — `AS` stream keeps raw Rect; missing/invalid AS leaves appearance unset but Square/Circle still keep raw Rect (no Line/PolyLine/Ink-style geometry expansion) with `BS/W` present. Fixtures prove Square `AS /On` keeps `{200,200,300,300}`, Circle missing AS keeps `{50,60,150,160}`, and Square invalid AS keeps `{10,20,110,120}` with `BS/W=2`. Leaf-mutation count is frozen at 39. Appearance-stream content bbox derivation, line endings `LE`, Widget named-state breadth, and whole-product parity remain unclaimed; `include_annotations` remains `PARTIAL`.


### read_pdf include_annotations highlight quadpoints residual (frozen TS v3.0.14)

A frozen three-case public-stdio `read_pdf` `include_annotations` highlight quadpoints residual is admitted: Highlight `QuadPoints` rewrite public `bounding_box` when appearance is unset or `AP/N` stream Resources lack `ExtGState` (pdf.js `HighlightAnnotation` ignores such streams); `AP/N` stream with `ExtGState` keeps raw Rect. Fixtures prove no-AP uses `{10,10,100,80}`, AP without ExtGState uses `{10,10,100,80}`, and AP with ExtGState keeps `{200,200,300,300}`. Leaf-mutation count is frozen at 39. Underline/Squiggly/StrikeOut quadpoints breadth, appearance-stream content bbox derivation, line endings `LE`, and whole-product parity remain unclaimed; `include_annotations` remains `PARTIAL`.


### read_pdf include_annotations text-markup quadpoints residual (frozen TS v3.0.14)

A frozen three-case public-stdio `read_pdf` `include_annotations` text-markup quadpoints residual is admitted: Underline/Squiggly/StrikeOut without appearance rewrite public `bounding_box` from `QuadPoints` (pdf.js text-markup annotations). Squiggly uses bottom-strip `[minX, minY-2*dy, maxX, minY+2*dy]` with `dy=(maxY-minY)/6`; Underline/StrikeOut use the full axis-aligned quad union. Fixtures prove Underline `{20,20,120,90}`, Squiggly `{30,6.666...,130,53.333...}`, StrikeOut `{40,40,140,110}`. Leaf-mutation count is frozen at 39.

### read_pdf include_annotations text-markup with-appearance residual (frozen TS v3.0.14)

A frozen three-case public-stdio `read_pdf` `include_annotations` text-markup with-appearance residual is admitted: Underline/Squiggly/StrikeOut with usable `AP/N` appearance keep raw Rect public `bounding_box` and do not rewrite from `QuadPoints` (pdf.js text-markup annotations only synthesize when appearance is unset). Fixtures prove Underline keeps `{200,200,300,300}`, Squiggly keeps `{150,160,250,260}`, and StrikeOut keeps `{100,110,210,220}` despite non-intersecting QuadPoints. Leaf-mutation count is frozen at 39. Appearance-stream content bbox derivation, line endings `LE`, Widget named-state breadth, and whole-product parity remain unclaimed; `include_annotations` remains `PARTIAL`.


### read_pdf include_annotations stamp/caret/fileattachment residual (frozen TS v3.0.14)

A frozen three-case public-stdio `read_pdf` `include_annotations` stamp/caret/fileattachment residual is admitted: Stamp, Caret, and FileAttachment markup annotations expose `subtype`/`contents`/`title`/`id`/`page` and keep raw Rect public `bounding_box` without appearance rewrite.

A frozen three-case public-stdio `read_pdf` `include_annotations` square/circle/widget residual is admitted: Square/Circle normalize inverted Rect public `bounding_box` like pdf.js `lookupNormalRect`; Widget annotations keep `subtype`/`contents`/`id`/`page`/`bounding_box` but do not project field `/T` as `title` (pdf.js `fieldName`, not `titleObj`). Leaf-mutation count is frozen at 41. Appearance-stream content bbox derivation, widget form-field parity, FreeText inverted breadth, and whole-product parity remain unclaimed; `include_annotations` remains `PARTIAL`.

### read_pdf include_annotations link-uri-normalize residual (frozen TS v3.0.14)

A frozen three-case public-stdio `read_pdf` `include_annotations` link-uri-normalize residual is admitted: Link URI public `url` follows pdf.js `createValidAbsoluteUrl`/`href` normalization — bare domain gains trailing `/`, path URLs keep path, and `www.` hosts get `http://` default protocol when absolute. Leaf-mutation count is frozen at 39. Relative URL `docBaseUrl` breadth, `javascript:` URI, Launch file breadth, and whole-product parity remain unclaimed; `include_annotations` remains `PARTIAL`.

### read_pdf include_annotations freetext-rect residual (frozen TS v3.0.14)

A frozen three-case public-stdio `read_pdf` `include_annotations` freetext-rect residual is admitted: FreeText public `bounding_box` follows pdf.js `lookupNormalRect` — inverted Rect is normalized, ordinary Rect is kept, and zero-width Rect is kept (not Popup-style nulling). Leaf-mutation count is frozen at 42. Appearance-stream content bbox derivation, richText RC, default appearance DA, and whole-product parity remain unclaimed; `include_annotations` remains `PARTIAL`.

### read_pdf include_annotations link-uri-name residual (frozen TS v3.0.14)

A frozen three-case public-stdio `read_pdf` `include_annotations` link-uri-name residual is admitted: Link URI Name becomes `/Name` like pdf.js `parseDestDictionary`; invalid absolute `javascript:` and relative paths keep the raw string via TS `url ?? unsafeUrl` fallback. Leaf-mutation count is frozen at 39. Relative URL `docBaseUrl` breadth, Launch file breadth, and whole-product parity remain unclaimed; `include_annotations` remains `PARTIAL`.

### read_pdf include_form_fields form button-default-off residual (frozen TS v3.0.14)

A frozen three-case public-stdio `read_pdf` `include_form_fields` form button-default-off residual is admitted: pdf.js `ButtonWidgetAnnotation` sets `defaultFieldValue` to `Off` when `DV` is null and `AP/N` is a named-state dict (checkbox/radiobutton). Without that `AP/N` shape, missing `DV` remains null. Fixtures prove checkbox AP → `default_value=Off`, radiobutton AP → `default_value=Off`, and checkbox no-AP → `default_value=null`. Leaf-mutation count is frozen at 45. Pushbutton AP default-off breadth, malformed-field breadth, and whole-product parity remain unclaimed; `include_form_fields` remains `PARTIAL`.

Without that AP shape, `V` remains authoritative and missing `DV` stays null. Fixtures prove `V=/Yes AS=/Off` → `value=Off`, `V=/Off AS=/Yes` → `value=Yes`, and no-AP `V=/Yes AS=/Off` → `value=Yes` with `default_value=null`. Leaf-mutation count is frozen at 45.

A frozen three-case public-stdio `read_pdf` `include_form_fields` form checkbox-export-empty-single residual is admitted: pdf.js checkbox `_processCheckBox` empty and single-key `AP/N` exportValues construction admits `AS`-selected exports (empty `AP/N` synthesizes `Off/Yes`; single non-`Off` key synthesizes `Off+key`) and forces `Off` for non-admitted `AS` values. Fixtures prove empty `AP/N` + `AS=/Yes` → `value=Yes`, single `/Foo` + `AS=/Foo` → `value=Foo`, and single `/Foo` + `AS=/Bar` → `value=Off`. Leaf-mutation count is frozen at 45.

Fixtures prove root `Plan` and intermediate `Plan.Opt` stubs remain type/value null, leaves with `AP` stream → `value=Gold`/`default_value=null`, leaves with `AP/N` stream → `value=Gold`/`default_value=null`, and leaves with named `AP/N` → `value=Gold`/`default_value=Off`. Leaf-mutation count is frozen at 90. Broken parent-chain intermediate breadth, malformed-field breadth, and whole-product parity remain unclaimed; `include_form_fields` remains `PARTIAL`.

### read_pdf include_form_fields form radio-broken-parent-chain residual (frozen TS v3.0.14)

A frozen three-case public-stdio `read_pdf` `include_form_fields` form radio-broken-parent-chain residual is admitted: when a radio intermediate group lacks a Parent link to the radio root, pdf.js drops leaf widgets (no inheritable `FT`) and names the intermediate via Parent-chain construction only (`Opt`, not `Plan.Opt`). Root `Plan` stub remains across AP stream / AP/N stream / named AP/N variants. Rust form extraction matches by using Parent-chain name construction and Parent-chain `FT`/`V`/`Ff`/`DV` inheritance instead of Kids-path downward inheritance. Leaf-mutation count is frozen at 24. Malformed-field breadth and whole-product parity remain unclaimed; `include_form_fields` remains `PARTIAL`.

### search_pdf prefer_speed tools/list (post-3.0.14 additive surface)

Pure-Rust tools/list intentionally exposes `search_pdf.prefer_speed` as a post-3.0.14 additive boolean property matching the current TypeScript surface. Frozen v3.0.14 input-schema ranges/enums remain enforced; `prefer_speed` is not a detached v3.0.14 residual claim. `prefer_speed` remains `PARTIAL`; `dropInFor3014` stays false and publish freeze remains enabled.


### search_pdf tesseract-tsv public-stdio subset (bounded)

A frozen two-case public-stdio `search_pdf` tesseract-tsv OCR subset is admitted over `v3014-visual-v1.pdf`: valid TSV level-5 words produce image-to-PDF `ocr_word` geometry on the search match, and malformed TSV soft-falls back to raw text without geometry. Leaf-mutation count is frozen at 34 with relocated fixture-root replay. `include_ocr_text_layer` remains `PARTIAL`; real tesseract binary health checks, selectable/OCR interleaving, URL single-fetch, and whole-product parity remain unclaimed. `dropInFor3014` stays false and publish freeze remains enabled.

### Cross-platform native package scaffold (bounded)

Optional native packages and a platform-scoped `bin/native/<platform>/` layout are scaffolded for `darwin-arm64`, `darwin-x64`, `linux-arm64-gnu`, `linux-x64-gnu`, and `win32-x64-msvc`. CI builds and uploads host binaries, but packages remain private and prepublish-blocked while `publishFreeze=true`. Default npm `latest` remains TypeScript 3.0.14; clean registry install/runtime verification and TS retirement remain unclaimed.

Local pure-Rust launcher smoke (`bun run smoke:native-launcher`) verifies staged platform-path binary resolution and MCP initialize on the host. This is not registry install proof.
