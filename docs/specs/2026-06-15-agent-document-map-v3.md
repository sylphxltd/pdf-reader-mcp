# Agent Document Map v3

Date: 2026-06-15
Status: active

## Goal

Make PDF Reader MCP expose a single agent-native map of a PDF: pages,
elements, selectable text-layer coverage, chunks, layout confidence, safety
findings, routing signals, OCR evidence, and page geometry. The map is the
stable contract that OCR, vision, formula, chart, and advanced table engines
can enrich without forcing agents to learn a new response shape each time.

## Product Positioning

This is a capability release track, not a one-feature patch track. Public
messaging should describe the shipped outcome as full-fidelity, agent-ready PDF
understanding with performance-bounded local execution. Do not mention external
projects or imply built-in OCR models, formula, chart, or tagged-PDF
generation before those capabilities are shipped and validated.

## Non-Goals

- Do not make OCR, VLMs, ONNX models, Python, Java, or remote services
  mandatory for the default TypeScript package.
- Do not put image base64 data inside the JSON document map.
- Do not create a second table, chunk, or element vocabulary.
- Do not publish a package release until the v3 capability batch is large
  enough to read as a planned milestone.

## Public Contract

`read_pdf` accepts:

```json
{
  "sources": [{ "path": "report.pdf", "pages": "1-5" }],
  "include_document_map": true
}
```

Each successful source may include:

## Invariants

- `document_map.pages[*].element_ids` must reference IDs present in
  `document_map.elements`.
- `document_map.pages[*].chunk_ids` must reference IDs present in
  `document_map.chunks`.
- `document_map.pages[*].safety_finding_indexes` must reference array indexes
  in `document_map.safety_findings`.
- `document_map.pages[*].visual_enrichment_indexes` must reference array
  indexes in `document_map.visual_enrichments`.
- `document_map.pages[*].text_layer_page_index` must reference the same-page
  record in the internally built or top-level `text_layer.pages` array.
- `document_map.visual_enrichments[*].target_element_id` must reference the
  table or image element whose crop was analyzed.
- `document_map.layers` must be derived from actual emitted layers, not user
  flags. `text_layer` is present only when selectable text-layer evidence was
  built. `ocr_text_layer` is present only when OCR pages were returned.
- Top-level legacy outputs remain opt-in. `include_document_map` may build
  internal elements, chunks, text-layer coverage, safety findings, layout
  diagnostics, page geometry, and tables for the map without forcing top-level
  `elements`, `chunks`, `text_layer`, `safety_findings`,
  `layout_diagnostics`, or `page_geometry`.
- JSON output must not include embedded image bytes.
- Visual enrichment is opt-in and provider-backed. If the provider is not
  configured or fails, `read_pdf` records a warning instead of failing the
  whole document read.
- Every map is deterministic for the same PDF bytes, selected pages, and parser
  version.

## Performance Constraints

- The map must reuse page content, table, layout, safety, chunk, and geometry
  data already produced in the request path. Text-layer coverage must be
  derived from the same text-layer builder used by `include_text_layer`.
- The builder itself must be linear in emitted pages, elements, chunks, and
  findings.
- Page extraction remains batched; document map construction must not increase
  source concurrency beyond the existing handler limit.
- OCR, VLM, and ONNX work belongs behind optional provider interfaces, with
  health checks and explicit enablement. `include_ocr_text_layer` is the
  explicit opt-in for OCR fusion and must keep OCR text separate from
  selectable text.
- `include_visual_enrichments` is the explicit opt-in for visual-region
  provider fusion. It must respect `max_visual_enrichments`, avoid embedding
  crop image bytes in JSON, and attach crop evidence IDs to the document twin.

## v3 Capability Batch

Required before publishing the next package release:

- `include_document_map` public schema, handler, types, tests, docs.
- Inspector recommendations include `include_document_map` for digital and
  mixed PDFs.
- `render_page`, `extract_regions`, `analyze_regions`, and `ocr_pages` provide
  visual evidence, focused crops, visual region enrichment, and configured OCR
  text layers without embedding image bytes in JSON summaries.
- `read_pdf` can opt into OCR text layer fusion for sparse/scanned pages and
  link applied OCR pages into the document map.
- `include_document_map` links selectable text-layer coverage into page records
  and summary totals without forcing the top-level `text_layer` response.
- `read_pdf` can opt into visual enrichment fusion for bounded table/image
  regions and link provider-backed table, formula, chart, figure, diagram, or
  image evidence into the document map and AST.
- `search_pdf` provides bounded evidence retrieval with snippets, offsets,
  optional character-derived or text-item bounding boxes, and provenance before
  heavier workflows.
- Quality eval proves the map links pages, elements, text-layer coverage,
  chunks, safety findings, layout diagnostics, and geometry.
- Handler tests prove the map does not force top-level legacy outputs.
- Public docs describe shipped configured OCR and configured visual enrichment
  accurately, and keep built-in OCR model, bundled VLM, and PDF/UA generation
  capabilities in roadmap language only.

Next slices for the same v3 track:

- Additional OCR provider presets, scanned fixtures, and accuracy/latency
  benchmarks.
- Engine-specific layout, table, formula, and chart provider presets and
  accuracy/latency fixtures.
- Benchmark harness with accuracy and latency reported separately.
- Broader fixtures for multi-column, forms, tables, scanned pages, hidden text,
  charts, and formulas.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `include_document_map` validates as an optional boolean.
- `read_pdf` with `include_document_map: true` processes selected pages even
  when `include_full_text` is false.
- The map includes semantic elements, selectable text-layer coverage, citation
  chunks, layout diagnostics, safety findings, routing signals, page geometry,
  and summary counts.
- The map includes table elements when deterministic table extraction finds
  tables.
- The map links OCR pages when `include_ocr_text_layer` returns OCR evidence.
- The map links visual enrichment evidence when `include_visual_enrichments`
  returns provider-backed region analysis.
- The AST attaches visual enrichment evidence to semantic nodes without
  duplicating table elements.
- The AST links captions to nearby matching table, image, figure, chart,
  formula, or diagram evidence without moving page-local nodes.
- The first JSON content part omits `page_contents` and image bytes.
- Existing `read_pdf` calls without `include_document_map` remain unchanged.
- `inspect_pdf` recommends the document map for agentic digital-text and mixed
  workflows.
- Full validation passes before merge.
