## Proven

- Empty production `dependencies`
- Clean install has **no** `pdfjs-dist` / MCP TS SDK
- All five native tarballs HTTP 200 and registry install+initialize green
- Force-TS fail-closed; missing native fail-closed
- Prefer **4.0.2** over 4.0.1 (`linux-x64-gnu@4.0.1` tombstoned)

## Not complete / not authorized

- Formal product-wide performance claims (`performanceClaimsAuthorized=false`)
- Goal complete (`goalCompleteAuthorized=false`)
- Historical suite measured startup-inclusive end-to-end samples with a weak semantic gate
- Customer README on npm tarball still older than post-audit GitHub README until a future admitted patch publishes docs

## Next closeout actions

1. Land customer-first README + matrix honesty + dual-mode perf harness
2. Re-admit performance only under rebuilt `persistent_warm` contract (or clearly labeled startup claims)
3. Successor independent review after evidence
4. If npm README must match, publish next admitted patch version
