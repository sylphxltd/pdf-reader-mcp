# Accessibility Report

Date: 2026-06-15
Status: implemented

## Goal

Give agents one deterministic accessibility-oriented report for PDFs before
they rely on tagged structure, headings, images, forms, links, or copy-based
accessibility workflows.

This is not a PDF/UA certification engine. It is a local routing and evidence
report derived from parser-exposed structure and already extracted document
signals.

## Non-goals

- Do not claim PDF/UA compliance.
- Do not generate or repair tags.
- Do not perform visual alt-text generation.
- Do not require OCR, cloud services, Python, Java, or heavyweight model
  dependencies.
- Do not force raw `permissions`, `mark_info`, `annotations`, `form_fields`, or
  `structure_trees` into the top-level `read_pdf` response.

## Public API

`read_pdf` accepts:

```json
{
  "sources": [{ "path": "document.pdf", "pages": "1-5" }],
  "include_accessibility_report": true,
  "include_full_text": false
}
```

The response includes `accessibility_report`:

## Signal Sources

The report may use these internal inputs:

- PDF mark info (`Marked`, `Suspects`) and permissions.
- Page structure trees from PDF.js `getStructTree`, including content
  references when exposed.
- Link annotations from PDF.js `getAnnotations`.
- Form fields from PDF.js `getFieldObjects`.
- Structured text, image, and table elements from the existing document element
  model.
- Outline entries when checking heading-role coverage.

## Issues

The report emits structured issues:

- `mark_info_missing`
- `untagged_pdf`
- `suspect_tags`
- `structure_tree_missing`
- `untagged_page`
- `heading_structure`
- `tagged_content_mismatch`
- `image_alt_text`
- `form_field_label`
- `link_label`
- `accessibility_permission`

Each issue carries severity, message, optional page, and optional evidence.
The summary also exposes document-vs-page issue totals, severity totals, issue
type totals, page-grade totals, and counts for pages that need follow-up, so
agents can route risky pages without scanning the full issue array first.

## Scoring

Scores start at 100 and subtract:

- High issue: 35
- Medium issue: 18
- Low issue: 8

Scores are clamped to 0-100.

Grades:

- `good`: 85-100
- `partial`: 60-84
- `weak`: 0-59

## Acceptance Criteria

- `include_accessibility_report` validates as an optional boolean.
- Report generation is deterministic and TypeScript-only.
- Report output is emitted without forcing raw permissions, mark info,
  annotations, form fields, or structure trees into top-level JSON.
- Unit tests cover document, page, tag-to-visible-content correlation, image,
  form, link, permission, and mark-info signals.
- Handler integration tests cover the public flag and response-shape isolation.
- Quality evals include a tagged structure case with content-reference coverage
  that must score `good` and expose routeable issue and page-grade summaries.
