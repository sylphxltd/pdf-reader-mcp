# Agent-Native PDF Inspection

Date: 2026-06-15
Status: active

## Goal

Add a lightweight MCP tool that lets an agent inspect a PDF before extracting it.
The tool should answer: what kind of PDF is this, which pages should be sampled,
what risks are visible, which `read_pdf` options are most useful next, and which
MCP tools should be used next for search, visual evidence, OCR, crop extraction,
or provider-backed enrichment.

This improves time-to-value without adding bundled OCR models, Java, Python,
cloud services, or any large default dependency.

## Non-goals

- Do not bundle or automatically perform OCR in the default package.
- Do not claim high-accuracy parsing from a short inspection sample.
- Do not extract image bytes during inspection.
- Do not replace `read_pdf`; inspection is an additive planning step.

## Contract

Expose a second MCP tool named `inspect_pdf`.

Input:

```json
{
  "sources": [{ "path": "report.pdf", "pages": "1-5" }],
  "sample_pages": 5,
  "include_metadata": true
}
```

Output is a JSON text part:

```json

      "success": true,

## Invariants

- Inspection returns per-source success or failure independently.
- Sampling is bounded and defaults to a small number of pages.
- `read_pdf_arguments` may recommend `include_ocr_text_layer` and
  `include_tables` together for scanned-page OCR table evidence, but must make
  OCR opt-in and dependent on a configured local provider with an available
  preset executable when a built-in OCR preset is selected.
- `next_tools` is ordered by `priority`; executable steps use `arguments`, while
  steps that need task input or region boxes use `argument_template` and
  `required_inputs`.
- `next_tools[].ready` means the step can be called immediately with the current
  arguments and provider readiness. OCR or visual-provider steps must become
  not ready when their provider is not configured, has invalid configuration, or
  the selected known OCR preset executable is unavailable.
- Provider readiness and health metadata must not expose local provider paths
  or arguments.
- The first JSON part must not include binary image data.
- Existing `read_pdf` callers remain unchanged.

## Validation

- Unit tests cover page sampling, profile classification, and ordered
  tool-routing recommendations.
- Handler tests cover successful digital and scanned/image-like PDFs.
- Integration tests confirm the MCP server lists `inspect_pdf`.
- Full validation: `bun run check`, `bun run build`, `bun test`, and
  `bun run docs:build`.
