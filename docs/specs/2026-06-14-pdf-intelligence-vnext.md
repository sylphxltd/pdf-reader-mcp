# PDF Intelligence vNext

Date: 2026-06-14
Status: active

## Goal

Make PDF Reader MCP the strongest practical PDF intelligence layer for AI
agents while preserving its current install experience: local-first, MCP-native,
simple to run with `npx`, and safe by default.

The product direction is not to become a monolithic PDF desktop converter. The
product direction is to become the agent-facing control plane for PDF
understanding: extraction, structure, citations, safety, and optional advanced
engines behind one stable MCP contract.

## Non-goals

- Do not make Java, Python, OCR models, or remote services mandatory for the
  default package.
- Do not replace the current `read_pdf` contract in a breaking release.
- Do not claim benchmark superiority until this repository has reproducible
  fixtures and published results.
- Do not implement PDF accessibility remediation before the structured document
  model is stable.
- Do not expose raw parser internals, filesystem paths, or binary payloads in
  JSON summaries.

## Domain Vocabulary

- Source: one local path or URL requested by the MCP caller.
- Document: normalized PDF output for one source.
- Page: one 1-indexed PDF page.
- Element: one structured content object on a page.
- Bounding box: best-effort PDF coordinate rectangle `[left, bottom, right, top]`.
- Engine: the parser backend that produces raw extraction data.
- Renderer: an output adapter that turns normalized document data into JSON,
  Markdown, MCP text parts, or image parts.
- Provenance: metadata describing which engine produced an element and how
  confident the server is.
- Document map: one agent-facing contract that links pages, elements, chunks,
  layout diagnostics, safety findings, routing signals, and page geometry.
- Search evidence: literal text matches with page numbers, snippets, offsets,
  optional character-derived or text-item bounding boxes, and provenance.
- OCR text layer: normalized text, confidence, optional word boxes, language,
  and provenance produced by an explicitly configured local OCR provider.

## Invariants

- Existing `read_pdf` callers keep working without changing arguments.
- The default engine remains local and dependency-light.
- Structured output is additive. It must not force large base64 data into the
  first JSON content part.
- Each public concept has one name across schema, types, docs, tests, and MCP
  responses.
- Every source result must preserve per-source success or failure isolation.
- Unknown parser failures are logged internally but returned to MCP callers as
  curated messages.

## Public Contract

First compatible slice:

```json
{
  "sources": [{ "path": "report.pdf", "pages": "1-3" }],
  "include_elements": true,
  "include_full_text": false,
  "include_metadata": true,
  "include_page_count": true
}
```

When `include_elements` is true, each successful source may include:

```json
{
  "elements": [
    {
      "id": "p1-text-1",
      "type": "text",
      "page": 1,
      "content": "Executive summary",
      "bounding_box": { "left": 72, "bottom": 720, "right": 240, "top": 732 },
      "provenance": { "engine": "pdfjs", "source": "text-content" }
    }
  ]
}
```

Future slices may add `heading`, `paragraph`, `list`, `table`, `image`,
`formula`, `caption`, `header`, and `footer` element types. The first slice
must not overstate semantic detection; text elements remain `text` until a
dedicated classifier exists.

## Architecture

Target boundary:

```text
MCP tool handler
  -> application/use case orchestration
    -> source loading and security policy
    -> engine adapter
    -> normalized document model
    -> renderers
```

Initial implementation can stay in the current modules, but new behavior should
move toward these ports:

```ts
interface PdfEngine {
  readonly name: string;
  parse(source: LoadedPdfSource, options: EngineOptions): Promise<ParsedDocument>;
}

interface PdfRenderer<T> {
  render(document: ParsedDocument, options: RenderOptions): T;
}
```

Candidate engines:

- `pdfjs`: default, local, current dependency set.
- `external-cli`: optional adapter for high-accuracy local parsers.
- `ocr`: optional local provider for scanned PDFs, enabled explicitly outside
  request payloads.
- `vision`: optional enrichment for charts, figures, and formulas.

## Phased Roadmap

1. Structured foundation
   - Add `inspect_pdf` for bounded preflight profiling, OCR triage, and
     ordered `next_tools` with recommended `read_pdf` arguments.
   - Add `include_elements`.
   - Add `include_semantic_hints`.
   - Add `include_markdown`.
   - Add `include_html`.
   - Add `include_chunks`.
   - Add `include_text_layer` for run records, line records, word records,
     character records, page-level ranges, estimated bounding boxes, and
     provenance.
   - Add document signals: outline, annotations, page labels, page geometry,
     permissions, structure trees, form fields, and attachment metadata.
   - Add deterministic content safety findings for agent workflows.
   - Add best-effort text and image element metadata.
   - Add best-effort table and table-cell geometry.
   - Add semantic, size, and table-aware chunk strategies.
   - Add layout diagnostics with reading-order confidence for agent routing.
   - Add `include_document_map` as the SSOT response shape for agent
     navigation and future optional engine enrichment.
   - Add `include_document_ast` as a semantic tree over the same element and
     chunk IDs for page/section/paragraph/list/caption/header/footer/table/image
     traversal with continued section context.
   - Add `include_trust_report` for consolidated content safety, layout,
     sparse-page, table quality, and external-link routing signals.
   - Add `include_accessibility_report` for deterministic tagged-PDF coverage,
     structure tree, heading, image, form, link, permission, and mark-info
     signals without claiming PDF/UA certification.
   - Add `search_pdf` for bounded evidence retrieval before heavier reading,
     rendering, cropping, or citation workflows.
   - Keep legacy outputs stable.
   - Add tests for schema, JSON response shape, and no binary data in JSON.

2. Layout accuracy
   - Add page geometry and real bounding boxes where available.
   - Add layout-aware reading order beyond simple Y sorting.
   - Split distant same-line text into independent segments, then apply
     conservative recursive band and column segmentation for common
     multi-column PDFs with spanning headers or footers.
   - Add page-level layout profiles, confidence scores, and warnings.
   - Add fixtures for multi-column pages, sidebars, headers, and footers.

3. Semantic extraction
   - Detect headings, paragraphs, lists, captions, headers, footers.
   - Improve tables with quality diagnostics, inferred row/column span hints,
     and multi-page continuation candidates.
   - Add Markdown renderer using the normalized element tree.

4. Safety and trust
   - Detect hidden, tiny, off-page, overlapping, and suspicious invisible text.
   - Add optional sensitive data redaction.
   - Add provenance, confidence, warnings, and trace-friendly logs.

5. Advanced engines
   - Add optional provider interface for high-accuracy local engines.
   - Add `ocr_pages` as the first optional OCR provider interface over bounded
     rendered pages.
   - Add `analyze_regions` for formula, chart, table, figure, and image
     description enrichment behind optional providers over bounded crop
     evidence.
   - Keep the default package lightweight.

6. Agent workflows
   - Add citation-ready chunks with page, semantic, size, table, and bounding
     box references.
   - Add search/index/cache tools for repeated agent work.
   - Add progress and resource telemetry for large PDFs.

7. Accessibility research
   - Audit accessibility report quality across broader tagged and untagged PDF
     fixtures.
   - Evaluate tagged PDF generation only after element model quality is proven.

## Validation Plan

- Unit tests for schema, element construction, page ordering, and binary
  stripping.
- Integration tests for MCP `read_pdf` with and without `include_elements`.
- Integration tests for MCP `read_pdf` with and without `include_document_map`.
- Integration tests for MCP `read_pdf` with and without
  `include_accessibility_report`.
- Integration tests confirm `inspect_pdf`, `search_pdf`, `render_page`,
  `extract_regions`, `analyze_regions`, and `ocr_pages` are exposed by the MCP
  server.
- Quality evals for semantic chunks, table ordering, renderers, and safety
  findings.
- Fixtures for simple text, multi-column reading order, tables, images, scans,
  hidden text, malformed PDFs, and URL security.
- Benchmarks must report accuracy and speed separately.
- Public docs must describe shipped capabilities only; roadmap items must be
  labeled as roadmap.

## Public Messaging Rules

- Talk about product outcomes, not inspirations or external comparisons.
- Do not mention external projects when describing improvements.
- Use neutral language: "structured", "agent-ready", "local-first",
  "citation-ready", "safe by default", "optional advanced engines".
- Do not imply built-in OCR models, formula extraction, chart description, or
  PDF/UA support before they are shipped and validated.
- Prefer measurable claims tied to tests, fixtures, or benchmarks in this repo.
