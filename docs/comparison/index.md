# Capability Overview

PDF Reader MCP is the most-starred open-source PDF MCP server on GitHub. It is
designed as a full-fidelity PDF intelligence layer for agents. The comparison
below is category-based and focuses on the agent workflow: read a smart Agent
Document Twin first, search cheaply when the task has a literal query, and
request focused evidence only when the answer needs source-level proof.

## Why It Matters

Agents need more than extracted text. For high-value PDFs they need to know
where content came from, which page or crop proves it, whether the reading order
looks uncertain, whether a page needs OCR, whether a table has weak geometry,
and whether hidden or unsafe content should be treated as untrusted data.

PDF Reader MCP exposes that as a compact V3 tool surface:

1. `read_pdf` is the default entrypoint. With only `sources`, it profiles the
   PDF, chooses useful extraction options, and returns the linked Agent Document
   Twin.
2. `search_pdf` finds source-backed text matches before spending more context
   on broad extraction or visual proof.
3. `pdf_evidence` handles focused follow-up operations: `inspect`,
   `render_page`, `extract_regions`, `ocr_pages`, and `analyze_regions`.

## When PDF Reader MCP Is The Better Fit

- You want agents to start with one intelligent PDF read instead of learning a
  long list of extraction tools.
- You need stable page, element, chunk, crop, table, OCR, trust, and
  accessibility references for downstream citations.
- You need local-first execution and want OCR or visual models configured by the
  deployment, not selected by each request.
- You need source evidence for tables, charts, formulas, figures, and scanned
  pages.
- You want public benchmark artifacts and a release gate that prove the shipped
  capability surface.

## Boundaries

PDF Reader MCP does not bundle heavy OCR, vision, formula, or layout model
weights. The default package stays TypeScript-first and local-first; advanced
OCR and visual understanding are enabled through explicit local providers and
validated through provider benchmarks.
